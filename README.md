A Python recreation of the classic **Pong** game, built using the `turtle` graphics module.  
The game includes player movement, ball collision, scoring, and dynamic speed increase.

## 🕹️ Gameplay

- Player 1 controls the **left paddle** using:
  - `W` → Move Up
  - `S` → Move Down

- Player 2 controls the **right paddle** using:
  - `Up Arrow` → Move Up
  - `Down Arrow` → Move Down

The ball bounces off walls and paddles.  
If a player misses the ball, the opponent scores a point.
